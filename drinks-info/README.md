# Drinks Info
## Introduction
This project is a hands-on exploration of connecting to external APIs using .NET's class library. Imagine you're working for a restaurant, and they want you to create a cool system for their drinks menu. The catch? The drink info is all stored in another company's database, which we access through an API. 

## Requirements
- ### Accessing External API: 
The restaurant's drinks menu is provided by an external company's database accessible through an API. The application must allow the restaurant employee to pull data from any drink in the database.

- ### User-Friendly Interface:
Create a system where users (restaurant employees) can easily navigate the drinks menu. Upon opening the application, they should be presented with the drinks category menu, from which they can choose a category and then select a drink to view detailed information.

- ### Complete Drink Information: 
When viewing drink details, ensure that there are no properties with empty values to provide comprehensive information to the users.
